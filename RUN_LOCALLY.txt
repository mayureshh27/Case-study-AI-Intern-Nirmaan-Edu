HOW TO RUN LOCALLY
==================

Follow these exact steps to run the AI Communication Scoring Tool on your local machine.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
Ensure you have the following installed:
1. Node.js (v18 or higher)
2. Python (v3.11 or higher)
3. pnpm (or npm)
4. uv (Python package manager) - Optional but recommended


STEP 1: BACKEND SETUP
---------------------
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   cd backend

3. Install dependencies:
   # Using uv (Recommended)
   uv sync
   
   # OR using pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Start the backend server:
   # Using uv
   uv run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   
   # OR using python directly
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

5. The backend is now running at http://localhost:8000
   - Health check: http://localhost:8000/health
   - API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs


STEP 2: FRONTEND SETUP
----------------------
1. Open a NEW terminal window (keep the backend running).
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   cd frontend

3. Create a .env file:
   - Copy .env.example to .env
   - Or create a new file named .env with this content:
     VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

4. Install dependencies:
   pnpm install

5. Start the frontend development server:
   pnpm dev

6. The frontend is now running at http://localhost:5173


STEP 3: USAGE
-------------
1. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173
2. You will see the "AI Communication Coach" interface.
3. Enter a transcript in the text area.
   Sample: "Hello everyone, myself Muskan, studying in class 8th B section from Christ Public School. I am 13 years old. I live with my family."
4. Click "Analyze Transcript".
5. View the detailed scores and feedback.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- Backend not starting? Check if port 8000 is free.
- Frontend API errors? Ensure the backend is running and VITE_API_URL is set correctly in frontend/.env
- CORS errors? The backend is configured to allow all origins (*) by default, so this shouldn't happen locally.
